\chapter{Model enhancement}
After having chosen the appropriate machine learning algorithms and found a way to determine the most important features in the classification problem, this chapter is an attempt to create a model able to enhance the results obtained by the basic classification. Three different approaches are presented. First of all, the most important features values were altered and the effect of this modification is examined. Second, a formula for calculating the distance between different samples is established then a way to use that information. Finally, the Hidden Markov Models were used in order to determine the likeliness of prediction of a particular class and this data was used to modify the machine learning algorithm.
