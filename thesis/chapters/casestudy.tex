\chapter{Case study}
In order to focus on the implementation of the hybrid machine learning algorithm, a CPS, with ready to use datasets, was chosen from a list provided in \cite{morris_industrial_nodate}: the \textbf{power system} \cite{adhikari_power_2014}, which network diagram was represented on figure \ref{fig:cps_rep}. The system is composed of two power generators who are alimenting the whole system. Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) R1 to R4 and the breakers BR1 to BR4 can be found connected directly to those generators. Each IED switches its corresponding breaker when a fault is detected, valid or fake. The communication between the IEDs and the Substation Switch is done wirelessly. On the other hand the Substation Switch is connected with the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) and the Control Room.

\end{figure}

The operation of this power system can be described following 6 main scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
    \item normal behaviour, 
    \item short-circuit,
    \item line maintenance,
    \item remotely opening the breakers (attack),
    \item disruption of fault protection system (attack),
    \item fault imitation (attack).
\end{itemize} 
Each of those scenarios can be divided into several sub-scenarios concerning different entities of the system or/and the failure range. Every scenario was labelled with a number between 1 and 41. In this way \textbf{37 scenarios} are obtained, divided and numbered as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 no events scenario, its number it is 41,
    \item 8 natural fault scenarios, its number ranges are 1-6 (short-circuit) and 13-14 (line maintenance),
    \item 28 attack scenarios, its number ranges are 7-12 (fault imitation), 15-20 (remotely opening the breakers), 20-30 and 35-40 (disruption of fault protection system).
\end{itemize}
The reason for dropping the numbers between 31 and 34 in the naming process of scenarios is not known.

The datasets provided in \cite{morris_industrial_nodate} represent \textbf{78377 events}, in which one of those scenarios was reproduced in the system. They have been grouped by scenario into 3 datasets: binary (attack or normal operation), three-class (attack, normal fault and no events) and multiclass (differentiating all 37 scenarios). Each of these 3 datasets is composed of 15 .arff or .csv files comporting in average 141 events for each of 37 scenarios. The exact number of events per file for each scheme is illustrated on figure \ref{fig:scen_distro_37}. For the 3 class dataset \textbf{55663 attack}, \textbf{18309 natural fault} and \textbf{4405 normal operation} events were found. The distribution of these schemes throughout the files is shown on figure~\ref{fig:scen_distro_file}.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:scen_distro_file} shows also this distribution for the binary datasets. It is sufficient to add the number of natural (orange) and normal operation (green) events.

The scenarios are not equally distributed in the case of the 37 schemes dataset, it is especially shown by the standard deviation of 61, which is an important value compared to some scenarios counting less than 100 events. On the other hand, in the case of 3-class scenarios, the distribution is even more not equal compared to the 37 schemes dataset. The \textbf{mean standard deviation among all files is equal to 1767}, which is an enormous result given that some scenarios count only around 100 events.

Every electrical grid around the world uses a \textbf{3-phased} electric power. Such a grid is composed of three alternating current generators combined. Those generators pass the current in three conductors. That way three conductors are obtained, and each of them conducts a phase of current named A, B and C respectively. The current phases have the same frequency, but a difference of phase of 1/3 of a cycle between each of them. In addition to that, each current has a corresponding voltage, with the same frequency and phases differences \cite{noauthor_three-phase_2020}.

In order to simplify the analysis of three-phase power systems, symmetrical components transformation is used, for both voltage and current. This transformation is defined as:
\begin{equation}
     \begin{bmatrix}
        V_0 \\ V_1 \\ V_2 
    \end{bmatrix} = \frac 1 3 \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 1& 1 \\
        1 & a & a^2 \\
        1 & a^2 & a
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        V_A \\ V_B \\ V_C
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{V_0}$, $\mathbf{V_1}$, $\mathbf{V_2}$ are called respectively \textbf{zero sequence}, \textbf{positive sequence} and \textbf{negative sequence}, $a = e^{i \frac{2\pi}{3}}$ and $V_A$, $V_B$, $V_C$ the A-C voltage phases \cite{jl_kirtley_jr_introduction_nodate}. As each sequence is a weighted sum of sinusoidal functions (A-C phases), it can be on its own written as one sinusoidal function after mathematical transformations.

Each phase is a \textbf{sinusoidal} function. Its equation form is $y = A \cdot \sin(\omega t + \theta)$, where $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ the angular frequency and $\theta$ the initial phase. Two terms will be used in what follows: the \textbf{magnitude} which is the absolute value of the amplitude and the \textbf{angle} which refers to initial phase. These two variables were illustrated on figure \ref{fig:sin}.

Moreover, when talking about electrical components, the term of impedance can come across. The impedance can be seen as a generalization of resistance of an electrical component. It is defined as the ratio of the voltage over current that passes through this component and takes a complex value of form $z = x + yi$. Every complex number can be also written in form of $z = e^{i\phi}$, where $\phi$ is the angle of the complex number $z$, and in this particular case the angle of the impedance.

Every previously mentioned event is described by \textbf{128 features}: 116 provided by four IEDs (each one provides 29 types of measurements) and 12 other features are reserved for control panel logs, snort \footnote{Snort - Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System} alerts, relay logs of 4 IEDs. The mentioned 116 features, each has a label formed by \textbf{concatenation} of the \textbf{source IED reference} (it can be R1, R2, R3, R4) and the \textbf{measurement name}, as provided in table \ref{tab:pmu_mes}. For example R4-PM5:I stands for phase B current phase magnitude measured by R4.

Those datasets have been used in several works related to CPS cyber-attack classification, one of which is \cite{borges_hink_machine_2014-1}, where the author try to find the most accurate algorithm to predict the status of the power system. The following chapter shows an attempt to partially reproduce the results obtained by them.
