\chapter{Machine learning algorithms comparison} \label{chap:methods}

Before going further and analysing neural networks, we will take a deeper look at classical machine learning algorithms, in particular Random Forests and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the context of anomaly detection in the CPS presented in chapter \ref{chap:intro}. However this was done before in \cite{borges_hink_machine_2014-1} using the black-box model only. In their approach they used Weka \cite{witten_appendix_2017} in order to find the most performant algorithm among 7 they have chosen (OneR, NNge, Random Forests, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, JRipper, Adaboost). 

The following sections show an attempt to reproduce the the results provided in \cite{borges_hink_machine_2014-1}, first using Weka, then scikit-learn \cite{pedregosa_scikit-learn_2011} to model the machine learning algorithms. The choice of scikit-learn was based on its versatility and configurability, which will be asset in further modifications of the used algorithms.
